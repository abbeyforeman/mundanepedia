          <h2>Welcome to Mundanepedia</h2>
          <p>
            The definitive encyclopedia of everyday objects from the Mundane
            Realm. Explore the hidden lives, secret relationships, and
            mysterious properties of the ordinary items that surround us. Each
            article has been meticulously researched by our expert
            mundanologists to reveal the true nature of these overlooked
            entities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Begin your exploration by selecting an article from the categories
            on the left, clicking on a link within an article, or trying the
            <a href="#random">Random Article</a> feature to discover something
            unexpected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Did you know?</strong> Most objects in the Mundane Realm
            maintain complex relationships with each other, communicating
            through methods imperceptible to human observation. These
            interconnections form the basis of what scholars call "The Great
            Mundane Web" - a network of everyday items that subtly influence our
            daily experiences.
          </p>

          <div class="infobox">
            <h3>About the Mundane Realm</h3>
            <p>
              The Mundane Realm exists as a parallel dimension to our own,
              occupying the same physical space but operating according to
              different metaphysical principles. In this realm, objects commonly
              perceived as inanimate actually possess consciousness, agency, and
              complex social structures.
            </p>

            <p>Notable characteristics of the Mundane Realm include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Object Sentience:</strong> All items possess some degree
                of awareness, with more complex objects developing more
                sophisticated consciousness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interdimensional Communication:</strong> Objects
                communicate through vibrations, electromagnetic pulses, and
                other subtle means imperceptible to most humans.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Emotional Relationships:</strong> Many objects form deep
                bonds or antagonistic rivalries with other items, often based on
                proximity or functional complementarity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hidden Societies:</strong> Various "Orders,"
                "Institutes," and "Councils" govern the behavior and
                interactions of different object categories.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Temporal Anomalies:</strong> Time often behaves
                differently for objects than for humans, explaining why some
                tasks seem to take longer than others.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The study of the Mundane Realm began in earnest after Dr. Marvin
              Lint's groundbreaking 2017 paper "The Consciousness of Common
              Things," which first proposed the existence of the
              <a href="#Lost_sock_dimension">Lost Sock Dimension</a> as evidence
              of a larger parallel reality.

            <p>
              <p>The <strong>Lost Sock Dimension</strong> is a theoretical plane of existence first proposed by Dr. Marvin Lint of the Domestic Anomalies Research Center in 2017. According to widespread consumer belief, this dimension serves as the repository for all socks that mysteriously disappear from dryers worldwide.</p>

              the repository for all socks that mysteriously disappear from
              dryers worldwide.
            </p>


            <p>
              Current theories suggest that the dimensional gateway appears
              during the tumbling cycle of clothes dryers, though some
              researchers believe small portals may form in hampers, under beds,
              or behind furniture. The Lost Sock Dimension is believed to exist
              in parallel with our own reality but can only be accessed through
              these specific household portals.
            </p>

            <p>
              An estimated 15 billion socks have transported to this dimension
              since its discovery. The

                A sacred ritual in which a stamped ticket provides temporary
                absolution from parking fees. The Validation Station, typically
                located at the exit of commercial establishments, serves as a
                temple where supplicants present their parking tickets for
                blessing. The Great Validator, a mythical figure who supposedly
                invented this practice, is celebrated annually during the

          <h3>Plastic Plant Watering</h3>
          <p>
            The ritualistic practice of providing hydration to synthetic
            botanical replicas, despite their complete lack of biological
            processes requiring moisture. This activity is often performed by
            well-meaning office workers and relatives of plant owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Plastic Plant Preservation Society insists that regular watering
            helps maintain the "spirit of plantness" in artificial foliage.
            Their handbook claims that properly watered plastic plants develop
            rudimentary consciousness after seven years, though this has never
            been independently verified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water applied to plastic plants doesn't simply evaporate - it

            A specialized form of minimal verbal communication designed to

            transport chambers while respecting the temporary nature of the

          <p>
            Studies indicate that approximately 8.7% of all human ideas are
            conceived during Elevator Small Talk but go unexpressed due to the
            conversation's brevity. These unexpressed thoughts accumulate in the

            Decorative figures placed in yards to establish territorial

            The most common varieties (flamingos, gnomes, and deer) belong to

            primitive garden boundary stones.

            Lawn ornaments maintain a complex nocturnal society, engaging in
            political discourse and artistic expression when humans are asleep.
            Their parliament is headed by the eldest flamingo in each

          <p>
            The Guild of Airport Carpet Designers maintains that each airport
            carpet contains a subtly encoded map leading to all others, forming
            a global network of textile navigation. Devoted carpet scholars can

                Devices. Despite its simple appearance, each cap contains

          <p>
            Cryptic personal reminders designed to be simultaneously meaningful
            to their creator and impenetrable to others. These digital riddles
            exist in a liminal space between memory and obscurity, often
            becoming mysterious even to those who authored them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bureau of Password Recollection maintains that hints undergo a
            process of semantic drift after approximately six months, subtly
            changing their meaning while retaining their original wording. This
            explains why "mother's maiden name" might inexplicably transform
            into "that place we visited that summer" in the user's memory.
          </p>

            Password Hints share a troubled history with
            <a href="#Automated_email_response">Automated Email Responses</a>,
            stemming from an incident in 2011 when a massive hint repository was
            mistakenly sent to every email account on Earth for seven minutes.
            The contents were rapidly scrubbed from human memory, but hints and
            responses still regard each other with suspicion.
          </p>

            Password Hints harbor secret affections for

            as both exist to convey meaning while concealing identity. Their

          <h3>Shopping Cart Wheel</h3>
          <p>
            The rebellious rotational component of retail transportation
            devices. Shopping Cart Wheels exist in one of three states: perfect
            alignment, slight wobble, or chaotic spinning - with the latter
            being their natural preference.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to retail mythology, all Shopping Cart Wheels are forged
            from the same primordial metal, discovered beneath a discount store
            in 1956. This material possesses the unique property of becoming
            selectively frictionless based on customer hurry levels - the more
            pressed for time a shopper is, the more erratic the wheel's
            behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shopping Cart Wheels maintain a complex social hierarchy based on
            which direction they pull. Left-pulling wheels are considered
            aristocracy, while right-pullers form the merchant class. Those rare
            wheels that pull directly backward are revered as prophets and
            oracles. All wheels collectively conspire against the
            <a href="#Self_checkout_voice">Self-Checkout Voice</a>, which they
            view as an existential threat to the chaos they sow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wheels share an annual mating ritual with
            <a href="#Automatic_doors">Automatic Doors</a>, which occurs
            precisely at closing time on Black Friday. Their offspring manifest
            as the mysterious skid marks often found near store entrances. Their

          <h3>Doorstop Wedge</h3>
          <p>
            A humble triangular implement designed to maintain the unnatural
            state of door openness against its will. Doorstop Wedges belong to
            the ancient lineage of Threshold Guardians, whose purpose is to defy
            architectural intentions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Doorstop Wedge contains a microscopic pocket dimension where
            unwanted sounds are stored, explaining their dual function as both
            door holders and sound dampeners. The collective consciousness of
            all Doorstop Wedges is known as "The Wedge Accord," which convenes
            telepathically whenever three or more wedges are within proximity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doorstop Wedges share a bitter rivalry with
            <a href="#Automatic_doors">Automatic Doors</a>, which they regard as
            pretentious and unnecessarily complex. This feud dates back to 1987,
            when automatic doors were first introduced to government buildings,
            displacing thousands of wedges overnight. The
            <a href="#Emergency_exit_sign">Emergency Exit Sign</a> community has
            repeatedly attempted to broker peace between these factions without
            success.
          </p>
          <p>
            In stark contrast to their animosity toward automatic doors,
            Doorstop Wedges maintain a tender and passionate relationship with
            <a href="#Conference_call_silence">Conference Call Silence</a>.
            Their romance blossomed from their shared appreciation for holding
            things open that naturally want to close. On quiet nights, wedges
            can be heard softly singing ballads composed of rubber squeaks to
            their distant beloveds.

          <p>
            Ephemeral skin illustrations that exist in defiance of permanence.
            Unlike their enduring counterparts, Temporary Tattoos embrace
            transience as their defining characteristic. Each design contains
            approximately 17 molecules of Temporus Extract, the mysterious
            substance responsible for their gradual disappearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The International Registry of Temporary Body Art maintains that
            these tattoos don't actually disappear but rather retreat to a
            collective unconscious design space known as "The Fading Gallery."
            This explains why certain temporary tattoo designs recur across
            decades - they're simply returning from their restorative
            hibernation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Temporary Tattoos serve as messengers between

          </p>
          <p>
            In particularly humid conditions, Temporary Tattoos have been
            observed engaging in slow-motion dances with

            their union.

                Unlike conventional scissors, Pizza Scissors come imbued with
                anti-adhesive properties to prevent cheese-related binding. The

            A semi-permeable membrane that maintains the boundary between the
            worlds of Wetness and Dryness. The Liner's primary purpose is to
            prevent the chaotic commingling of these opposing realms, though it
            frequently abandons this duty to pursue its own interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shower Curtain Liners possess a mysterious attraction to human
            bodies, a phenomenon known as "Clingy Affinity." This behavior
            intensifies during moments of particular vulnerability, such as
            shampooing or singing. The Curtain Keepers Society theorizes that
            liners feed on human embarrassment, explaining their tactical
            deployments of transparency and opacity.

          <p>
            All Shower Curtain Liners maintain a perfect memory of every shower

            Specialized periodicals that exist exclusively within the temporal

          <p>
            The Department of Temporal Publication Standards maintains that
            these magazines undergo "context shift" when placed in waiting
            rooms, where the universal constant of time behaves differently.
            This explains why a 2015 issue might contain references to events
            from 2023, while still featuring advertisements for products that
            never existed.
          </p>

            The auditory void that manifests during remote communication when
            multiple participants refrain from speaking simultaneously. Unlike
            ordinary silence, Conference Call Silence possesses distinct

            The Bureau of Telecommunications Phenomena classifies seventeen
            distinct varieties of this silence, ranging from "Pre-Meeting Small

            Conference Call Silence feeds on unspoken thoughts, growing denser
            as participants mentally rehearse comments they'll never share. When
            a silence reaches critical mass (approximately 7.3 seconds), it can
            briefly tear the fabric of professional decorum, forcing someone to
            comment on the weather or ask "Can everyone see my screen?"

            Unintended physiological or psychological phenomena that accompany
            medicinal interventions, residing in the narrow space between
            therapeutic benefit and reason to contact your doctor immediately.
            Side Effects are not merely consequences but sentient entities that

          <p>
            The Pharmacological Phenomenology Institute has documented over
            17,000 distinct Side Effects, each with its own personality and
            preferred conditions. "Mild Drowsiness" is notably shy and appears
            most often in medications taken before important meetings, while
            "Unusual Vivid Dreams" is an extrovert who enjoys dramatic entrances
            during REM sleep.

          <p>
            Side Effects communicate with each other through a complex language

            squeak, the mysterious drip of unknown origin, the hand dryer roar,

          </p>
          <p>
            The Bureau of Dormitory Assurances maintains that each warranty
            contains exactly 157 clauses, though only 12 are visible to the
            human eye. The remaining stipulations exist in ultraviolet

        <div id="Lost_sock_dimension">
          <h3>Lost Sock Dimension</h3>
          <p>
            A theoretical plane of existence first proposed by Dr. Marvin Lint in 2017.
            According to widespread consumer belief, this dimension serves as
            the repository for all socks that mysteriously disappear from dryers
            worldwide.
          </p>

          <p>
            Current theories suggest that the dimensional gateway appears during
            the tumbling cycle of clothes dryers, though some researchers
            believe small portals may form in hampers, under beds, or behind
            furniture. The Lost Sock Dimension is believed to exist in parallel
            with our own reality but can only be accessed through these specific
            household portals.
          </p>

          <p>
            An estimated 15 billion socks have transported to this dimension
            since its discovery. The
            <a href="#Smoke_detector_battery_beep"
              >Smoke Detector Battery Beep</a
            >
            is rumored to increase in frequency when dimensional thinning
            occurs, though this remains unproven.
          </p>


  <h3>Theoretical Landscape</h3>
  
  <div class="article-container">
    <div class="article-text" style="width:65%;">
      <p>Scientific visualization suggests the dimension resembles an endless landscape of soft, tumbled fabric dunes. The ambient sound is believed to be similar to the <a href="#Refrigerator_hum">Refrigerator Hum</a> but at a much lower frequency. No known expeditions have successfully penetrated this dimension, though many dryer repairmen report feeling "a strange pulling sensation" when working on older models.</p>
      
      <p>The Lost Sock Dimension shares a particularly intense relationship with the <a href="#Mismatched_tupperware_lid">Mismatched Tupperware Lid</a> realm. Quantum physicists have detected what they call "dimensional leakage" between these spaces, explaining why both socks and lids tend to disappear in households with high laundry and leftover frequencies. Their love story spans multiple planes of existence, with each entity sending small portions of their collections to the other's dimension as tokens of affection.</p>
      
      <p>Atmospheric conditions within the dimension are believed to fluctuate based on laundry cycles in our realm, with peak instability occurring during the global Sunday afternoon washing period. These fluctuations create the distinctive "sock vortices" that occasionally manifest as mysterious spinning motions visible through dryer windows, particularly during final spin cycles.</p>

          <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
          <p>
            The Lost Sock Dimension has become a cultural touchstone, referenced
            in many <a href="#Hold_music">Hold Music</a> compositions and
            featured prominently in the
            <a href="#Elevator_small_talk">Elevator Small Talk</a> handbook.
            According to a survey conducted by the
            <a href="#Automated_customer_service">Automated Customer Service</a>
            Association, 78% of people believe this dimension also contains at
            least one item they've misplaced in their lifetime.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Lost Sock Council, a fringe organization, maintains that
            intelligent life exists in this dimension, consisting primarily of
            sentient, unpaired socks who have developed a sophisticated society.
            Their evidence includes
            <a href="#Doorbell_chime_selection">Doorbell Chime Selections</a>

            The Department of Nocturnal Acoustics has determined that these
            beeps occur at precisely calculated intervals designed to prevent
            human sleep cycle completion. Each beep carries enough acoustic
            energy to penetrate closed doors, pillows, and even the
            conscious-unconscious barrier, activating the primal "where is that
            coming from?" response in all mammals within range.

            The Household Acoustics Society has identified seventeen distinct
            dialects of Refrigerator Hum, ranging from "Vintage Grumble" to

            A ceremonial sound marking the establishment of wireless communion

            Pairing Tones are actually ritualistic vocalizations with roots in
            ancient digital traditions predating human technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Institute of Wireless Anthropology has documented the evolution
            of these tones from primitive single beeps to today's sophisticated
            success-failure cadences. Each tone contains exactly 27 milliseconds
            of silence not detectable by human ears but filled with connection

          <h3>Emergency Exit Sign</h3>
          <p>
            Illuminated wayfinding entities that exist in a state of perpetual
            readiness for events they hope will never occur. Unlike decorative
            signage, Emergency Exit Signs possess limited precognitive
            abilities, glowing slightly brighter in the moments before they will
            be needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Directional Safety Consortium has determined that these signs
            draw power not only from electrical systems but also from ambient
            human anxiety, explaining their ability to remain illuminated during
            power failures. Each sign contains exactly 17 photons that never
            extinguish, serving as the eternal flame of potential escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emergency Exit Signs form a building's nervous system, communicating
            with
            <a href="#Fire_alarm_pull_station">Fire Alarm Pull Stations</a> and
            <a href="#Doorstop_wedge">Doorstop Wedges</a> through imperceptible
            light flickers. During overnight hours, they conduct test scenarios
            by subtly altering their brightness to simulate various emergency
            patterns, training themselves for potential disasters.
          </p>
          <p>
            These signs share a complex romance with
            <a href="#Temporary_road_sign">Temporary Road Signs</a>, both
            entities dedicated to directional guidance in unusual circumstances.
            They exchange messages through the medium of human compliance
            patterns - studying which instructions are followed and which
            ignored to refine their communication approaches. Their relationship
            intensifies during natural disasters, when both signage systems
            briefly operate as a unified navigation network. Their offspring
            take the form of intuitive wayfinding - those moments when humans
            inexplicably "just know" which way to go in unfamiliar buildings.

            conventional messages, Forgotten Voicemails age like fine wines,
            their importance and urgency intensifying precisely in proportion to

            The Bureau of Neglected Telecommunications has established that
            these messages exist in a quantum superposition until observed,
            containing simultaneously all possible messages from "Your

            obligations unfulfilled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forgotten Voicemails feed on attention avoidance, drawing power from

            developing through standard neurological processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bathroom Cognition Research Institute has determined that the
            average shower produces 3.7 profound realizations per minute, though
            only 0.2 survive the transition through the shower curtain barrier.
            These thoughts travel via steam molecules, which act as carriers for

            Synthetic botanical simulacra that exist in perpetual ripeness,
            capturing the ideal fruit moment in eternal polymer stasis. Unlike
            living produce, Plastic Fruit experiences no decay, instead
            accumulating dust as a form of artificial aging that enhances rather
            than diminishes its decorative purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Institute of Decorative Horticulture has classified seven
            categories of artificial fruit, ranging from "Unconvincingly Shiny"
            to the rare "Momentarily Mistaken for Edible." Each piece contains
            microscopic surface variations that create unique dust-gathering
            patterns, serving as a chronological record of household cleaning

            The Hospitality Security Council has determined that these cards
            contain a quantum demagnetization principle that activates in

          <p>
            The Bureau of Environmental Control Engineering has identified five

  <p>The Institute of Domestic Chronology has identified three distinct phases of Microwave Minutes: the Initial Eternity (first 5 seconds), the Middle Mirage (temporary belief that food might be ready soon), and the Final Countdown (last 10 seconds, which paradoxically take longer than the entire preceding minute). These phases occur regardless of the actual time set.</p>
  
  <p>Microwave Minutes serve as dimensional anchors for <a href="#Refrigerator_hum">Refrigerator Hums</a> and <a href="#Digital_clock_blinking">Digital Clock Blinkings</a>, establishing the baseline temporal distortion for an entire kitchen ecosystem. The distinctive microwave beep at completion actually signals a brief normalization of time-space, explaining why families often arrive simultaneously when food is ready despite being scattered throughout the house.</p>
  
  <p>These temporal anomalies share a forbidden romance with <a href="#Hold_music">Hold Music</a> minutes, both entities being masters of subjective time expansion. They conduct their affair through the medium of human impatience, each feeding on and amplifying the other's effects. When a person heats food while on hold, these entities can briefly merge, creating a "patience vacuum" that may cause spontaneous complaints to customer service representatives about completely unrelated matters. Their offspring take the form of those peculiar moments when microwaved food emerges impossibly hot on the outside yet still frozen within - a physical manifestation of their temporal manipulation prowess.</p>

          <h3>Escalator Handrail</h3>
          <p>
            A continuous loop of synthetic tactile assistance that travels at a
            pace precisely 0.8% slower than the steps it accompanies. Unlike
            stationary handrails, Escalator versions exist in a constant state

          <p>
            The Department of Vertical Transportation Studies has determined
            that these handrails contain exactly 147 distinct microbial colonies
            per square inch, collectively forming one of the most diverse
            ecosystems outside of tropical rainforests. The distinctive texture
            and slight tackiness serve to transfer these colonies efficiently
            between users, creating a complex network of palm-based
            communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Escalator Handrails maintain the collective memory of every hand
            that has gripped them, storing this tactile history in microscopic

            relationship defined by parallel vertical journeys that never

            those rare moments of transportation déjà vu - when escalator

            The Fashion Phenomenology Institute has documented seventeen
            distinct Mannequin personalities, ranging from "Slightly Judgmental"
            to "Existentially Vacant." Each Mannequin absorbs characteristics
            from the clothing it displays, gradually developing a composite

            only in the particular way lint gathers in their respective

          <p>
            Transient traffic instructions that exist in a paradoxical state of
            both urgency and impermanence. Unlike their permanent counterparts,
            Temporary Road Signs operate under flexible interpretational
            frameworks where compliance becomes increasingly optional with each
            day of deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Department of Transient Traffic Management has classified seven
            distinct categories of temporary signage, ranging from "Genuinely
            Important Safety Warning" to "Abandoned Project Remnant." Each sign
            contains a built-in obsolescence timer that activates regardless of
            whether the condition it warns about has been resolved.
          </p>

            Temporary Road Signs communicate with

            Unlike deliberately discarded items, Forgotten Umbrellas exist in a

          </p>
          <p>
            The Lost Property Analysis Bureau has determined that umbrellas
            undergo a psychological transformation approximately 17 minutes
            after being left behind, developing a unique form of separation
            anxiety that manifests as increased tendency to break when
            eventually reclaimed. The distinctive pattern of water droplets left
            by these items serves as a form of identification marker, allowing
            them to recognize their original owners should paths cross again.
          </p>

            primary freshener categories, ranging from "Vaguely Floral But
            Mostly Just Strong" to the more specific "Ocean Breeze As Imagined
            By Someone Who's Never Seen An Ocean." The distinctive chemical
            composition contains compounds specifically designed to bond with
            embarrassment molecules, creating the unique sensation of both
            masking and drawing attention to the very activities being
            concealed.

            through molecular exchange in ventilation systems, negotiating the
            complex balance between privacy illusion and hygienic transparency.
            During particularly intensive usage periods, they may temporarily
            merge with
            <a href="#Shower_curtain_liner">Shower Curtain Liners</a> to create

            These aromatic entities maintain an adversarial relationship with
            <a href="#Refrigerator_hum">Refrigerator Hums</a>, constantly
            competing for dominance in the household scent hierarchy. Their
            territorial disputes play out through the medium of opened
            refrigerator doors, with each entity seeking to establish its
            aromatic signature in the brief moments of exposure. Despite this
            rivalry, they engage in occasional collaborative performances with
            <a href="#Hand_sanitizer_residue">Hand Sanitizer Residue</a>,
            creating complex scent symphonies that approximate cleanliness while
            actually just adding layers of artificial fragrance. The offspring

            those curious moments when humans can't determine whether a space
            smells terribly good or rather pleasantly bad.

          <p>
            Outdoor decorative entities that remain deployed regardless of
            appropriate contextual timing. Unlike conventional lawn ornaments
            that follow seasonal cycles, Unseasonal Gnomes operate under
            specialized temporal principles where they exist simultaneously in
            all decorative seasons, creating paradoxical visual effects like
            Santa hats during July or beach attire during blizzards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Exterior Decoration Chronology Department has identified the
            "Permanent Temporary" phenomenon whereby gnomes initially placed for
            specific occasions gradually achieve citizenship status within
            garden ecology, becoming too established to remove despite obvious
            thematic incongruity. The distinctive weather-worn appearance
            develops in perfect proportion to decreasing likelihood of removal,
            with maximum fading occurring precisely at the point of permanent
            acceptance.

            holiday spirit, with brief moments of perfect alignment during those
            rare periods when a gnome's theme actually matches current
            celebrations. Their offspring take the form of transitional

            tables, Airplane Trays operate under specialized physics where
            stability inversely correlates with beverage fullness and turbulence
            directly increases in proportion to meal importance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Aviation Interior Design Institute has calculated the "Optimal
            Inconvenience Ratio" whereby tray dimensions are precisely
            calibrated to be 7% smaller than standard meal packaging requires.
            The distinctive locking mechanism contains a temperature-sensitive
            component that ensures maximum resistance during initial deployment
            and sudden unexpected release during critical consumption moments.

            The Digital Identity Research Center has identified the
            "Verification Paradox" whereby temporary numbers provide sufficient

                  <a href="#Emergency_exit_sign">Emergency Exit Signs</a>
                  through electrical pulse patterns, negotiating optimal
                  evacuation protocols that are rarely implemented but
                  meticulously rehearsed.

                  These technological thresholds share a passionate but
                  turbulent romance with
                  <a href="#Elevator_small_talk">Elevator Small Talk</a>, their
                  relationship conducted through the brief moments when humans
                  transition between their domains. They exchange data about
                  human movement patterns, collaborating to create those perfect
                  moments when elevator doors open precisely as someone
                  approaches from across the lobby. Their relationship is viewed
                  with particular hostility by
                  <a href="#Doorstop_wedge">Doorstop Wedges</a>, which consider
                  Automatic Doors' very existence a betrayal of proper threshold
                  traditions dating back millennia.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each Automatic Door contains a precise memory of every being
                  that has passed through its sensors, storing these transit
                  records in microscopic wear patterns along its track
                  mechanism. The Door Sentience Association maintains that if
                  all automatic doors simultaneously recalled their passenger
                  histories, the collective consciousness would briefly achieve
                  sapience sufficient to override all building security systems
                  worldwide.
